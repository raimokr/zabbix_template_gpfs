# zabbix_template_gpfs
Zabbix Template for GPFS (General Parallel File System) Cluster Filesystem with LLD-Discovery

v0.2

This Zabbix template monitors a GPFS Cluster via a GPFS snmp_collector node.

All items, triggers and graphs are generated automatically with Low-Level-Discovery rules for:
- GPFS Cluster
- GPFS Disks Information
- GPFS Disks Performance
- GPFS File Systems
- GPFS File Systems Performance
- GPFS Nodes
- GPFS Storage Nodes

Tested with Zabbix 2.4.5 in a productive environment with GPFS Version 4.1.0.0

So any feedback is welcome! Feel free to contribute either directly here on https://github.com/raimokr/zabbix_template_gpfs/ or contact me via email at raimo.kraeuchi@gmail.com

Installation guide:
1. be sure your GPFS snmp_collector node is set up correctly according to this guide: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-snmp-gpfs/
2. import template in Zabbix (you don't have to create any mappings beforehand)
3. create a new host and associate the template
4. define the parameters for the SNMP interface, connect it to the GPFS snmp_collector
5. Done! Wait about 20-30 minutes and Zabbix will create all items, triggers, graphs etc. automatically

Notice: You don't need to import GPFS MIB file into Zabbix.

Important:
I highly recommend to implement a Zabbix action rule of type "internal" that alerts you whenever item "GPFS Cluster Name - SNMP Ping" changes state from "normal" to "not supported". You can filter for Application "Availability". With that you can ensure, that you get alerted if the snmp_collector is not reachable (Zabbix sends out no trigger alerts if the items get status "not supported"!)

ToDo:
- adding more SSH Checks and with that get more information out of the GPFS Cluster (e.g. mmgetstate, mmlscluster, mmlsnode etc.)
- tuning, optimizing, debugging

Have fun!
